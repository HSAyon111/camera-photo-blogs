                <p>In January 2021, I went to my village home and stayed there for a few days. That was the time of
                    winter
                    season. In the evening of day 2, me and my freinds gatthered some woods. Then we set them on fire
                    for
                    enlighting the place. Also we warmed our hands and bodies by the fire flames. The outside weather
                    was
                    cold so the burning woods was helpful to increase the temparatures. That time I clicked this photo
                    with
                    my camera. The day was quite enjoyable.</p>

            <p id="custom-1">Last year on December 16, I went to TSC to see the decorations from Dhaka University to
                celebrate the
                Victory Day of Bangladesh. The place was so colorful and National flags were hanged and painted
                everywhere. This picture of big flag, hanging from the top of this building with birdy sculpture was
                taken from me in the afternoon.</p>

            <p id="custom-2">This photo was taken in a rainy day. I was going to Mawa Ferry Ghat last year by a bus. The
                bus journey
                was special because I enjoyed rain insdie from there through the window. The rain was heavy and the
                water drops were hitting on the glass. The view was amazing. So I couldn't help myself to pick my phone
                and take a photo of the wet window view!</p>

            <p id="custom-3">Dew is water in the form of droplets that appears on thin, exposed objects in the morning
                or evening due to condensation.


                Dense dew on grass
                As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat, atmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater
                than that at which it can evaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets.

                When temperatures are low enough, dew takes the form of ice; this form is called frost.

                Because dew is related to the temperature of surfaces, in late summer it forms most easily on surfaces
                that are not warmed by conducted heat from deep ground, such as grass, leaves, railings, car roofs, and
                bridges.

                Dew should not be confused with guttation, which is the process by which plants release excess water
                from the tips of their leaves.</p>

            <p id="custom-5">A garden is a place full of green grass and flowers, where everyone gets a lot of peace by
                visiting. The garden has green grass on every side, on which walking barefoot in the morning feels very
                good. There are different types of trees in the garden, which bear fruit, etc.

                Many birds make their nests on trees and the sound of their chirping in the morning and evening sounds
                very adorable. There are many types of colourful flowers in the garden which suit everyone and
                butterflies hover over them. Spending some time in the garden every day is good for mental and physical
                health.

                The most crowded garden is in the evening because at that time everyone goes for a walk. Some people are
                having a conversation, then somewhere the children are playing. There are many different types of
                gardens like fruit garden, flower garden and garden for walking.

                The garden which is made for walking has a paved road around it, where people can take a leisurely
                stroll. Many tired people rest in the gardens. Natural beauty is seen in the garden, which brings great
                satisfaction to the mind.</p>
