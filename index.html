                <p>In January 2021, I went to my village home and stayed there for a few days. That was the time of
                    winter
                    season. In the evening of day 2, me and my freinds gatthered some woods. Then we set them on fire
                    for
                    enlighting the place. Also we warmed our hands and bodies by the fire flames. The outside weather
                    was
                    cold so the burning woods was helpful to increase the temparatures. That time I clicked this photo
                    with
                    my camera. The day was quite enjoyable.</p>

            <p id="custom-1">Last year on December 16, I went to TSC to see the decorations from Dhaka University to
                celebrate the
                Victory Day of Bangladesh. The place was so colorful and National flags were hanged and painted
                everywhere. This picture of big flag, hanging from the top of this building with birdy sculpture was
                taken from me in the afternoon.</p>

            <p id="custom-2">This photo was taken in a rainy day. I was going to Mawa Ferry Ghat last year by a bus. The
                bus journey
                was special because I enjoyed rain insdie from there through the window. The rain was heavy and the
                water drops were hitting on the glass. The view was amazing. So I couldn't help myself to pick my phone
                and take a photo of the wet window view!</p>
